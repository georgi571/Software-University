            <h1>Why Flexbox?</h1>
            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
                features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and
                frustrating.</p>
            <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any
                kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
                    regardless of
                    how much width/height is available.
                </li>
                <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a
                    different amount
                    of content.
                </li>
            </ul>
            As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
