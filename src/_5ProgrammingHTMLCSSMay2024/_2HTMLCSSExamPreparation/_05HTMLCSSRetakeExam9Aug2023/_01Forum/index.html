                        <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always
                            do
                            that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct

                            accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common

                            to attain
                            uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team
