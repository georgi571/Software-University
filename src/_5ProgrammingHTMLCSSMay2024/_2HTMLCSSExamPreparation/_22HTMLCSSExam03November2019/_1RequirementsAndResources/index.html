                        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
                            According to
                            radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
                            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on
                            Earth. The
                            gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
                            orientation on its axis,
                            and gradually slows its rotation.</p>
