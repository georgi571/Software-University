                    <p>Medium is not like any other platform on the internet.
                        <span>Our sole purpose is to help you find compelling ideas,
                        knowledge, and perspectives.</span>
                        We don’t serve ads—we serve you, the curious reader who loves to
                        learn new things.
                        Medium is home to thousands of independent voices, and we combine humans and technology to find
                        the best reading
                        for you—and filter out the rest.</p>
